## Tool Stack

| Tool | Role | Setup Reference |
|---|---|---|
| `sqlcmd` (Go) | **Primary**: Execute DDL/DML T-SQL. Standalone binary, no ODBC, built-in Entra ID auth. | See [COMMON-CLI.md](../../../common/COMMON-CLI.md) for installation and authentication prerequisites. |
| `sqlpackage` | Schema deployment (.dacpac), database portability (.bacpac). | See [COMMON-CLI.md](../../../common/COMMON-CLI.md) for installation and environment setup prerequisites. |
| `az` CLI | Fabric REST for endpoint discovery and database creation. | See [COMMON-CLI.md](../../../common/COMMON-CLI.md) for Azure CLI authentication and token setup. |
| `jq` | Parse JSON from `az rest`. | See [COMMON-CLI.md](../../../common/COMMON-CLI.md) for shared CLI/tooling prerequisites. |

> **Agent check** — before first operation, confirm the required CLI tools and authentication are already configured by following the shared setup guidance in [COMMON-CLI.md](../../../common/COMMON-CLI.md). Do not duplicate install or `az login` steps in this skill.

## Connection

### Discover the SQL Database TDS Endpoint

For workspace/item resolution, SQL Database endpoint discovery, and CLI connection patterns, use the shared guidance in `common/COMMON-CLI.md` and `common/COMMON-CORE.md` instead of embedding `az rest` or `sqlcmd` recipes here.

> Follow the SQL Database endpoint discovery steps in [COMMON-CLI.md](../../../common/COMMON-CLI.md), then bring the discovered server FQDN and database name back into this skill for SQLDB-specific authoring and deployment tasks.

- Use the SQL Database endpoint values returned by Fabric for the target item; do not hardcode endpoint domains or database names.
- When generating deployment or authoring steps, treat connectivity details as inputs discovered via the shared common guidance.
- Focus this skill on schema authoring, DDL/DML design, constraints, indexing, source control, SqlPackage deployment, and GraphQL/API behaviors rather than connection bootstrapping.

### Connection guidance

If the user needs help connecting interactively or from CI/CD, refer them to `common/COMMON-CLI.md` for the shared `sqlcmd` setup, authentication, and invocation patterns.

For SQLDB-specific authoring in this skill, assume the connection inputs are already known:
- `serverFqdn`
- `databaseName`

## Agentic Workflows

### Schema Discovery Before Authoring

Before any write operation, discover the target schema:

```bash
# 1. List tables
$SQLCMD -Q "SELECT table_schema, table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_type='BASE TABLE' ORDER BY 1,2" -W

# 2. Check columns
$SQLCMD -Q "SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable, column_default FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name='Orders' ORDER BY ordinal_position" -W

# 3. Sample data
$SQLCMD -Q "SELECT TOP 5 * FROM dbo.Orders" -W

# 4. Check constraints
$SQLCMD -Q "SELECT tc.constraint_name, tc.constraint_type, kcu.column_name FROM information_schema.table_constraints tc JOIN information_schema.key_column_usage kcu ON tc.constraint_name=kcu.constraint_name WHERE tc.table_name='Orders' ORDER BY tc.constraint_type" -W

# 5. Check indexes
$SQLCMD -Q "SELECT i.name, i.type_desc, STRING_AGG(c.name,', ') WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY ic.key_ordinal) AS cols FROM sys.indexes i JOIN sys.index_columns ic ON i.object_id=ic.object_id AND i.index_id=ic.index_id JOIN sys.columns c ON ic.object_id=c.object_id AND ic.column_id=c.column_id WHERE i.object_id=OBJECT_ID('dbo.Orders') GROUP BY i.name, i.type_desc" -W

# 6. Row counts
$SQLCMD -Q "SELECT s.name AS [schema], t.name AS [table], SUM(p.rows) AS row_count FROM sys.tables t JOIN sys.schemas s ON t.schema_id=s.schema_id JOIN sys.partitions p ON t.object_id=p.object_id AND p.index_id IN (0,1) GROUP BY s.name, t.name ORDER BY row_count DESC" -W

# 7. Programmability objects
$SQLCMD -Q "SELECT name, type_desc FROM sys.objects WHERE type IN ('V','FN','IF','P','TF','TR') ORDER BY type_desc, name" -W
```

### Workflow

1. **Discover** → Run steps 1–5 to understand available tables/columns.
2. **Sample** → `SELECT TOP 5` on relevant tables.
3. **Formulate** → Select pattern from [SQLDB-AUTHORING-CORE.md](../../../common/SQLDB-AUTHORING-CORE.md) (Table DDL, Temporal Tables, Data Virtualization, Views, DML, etc.).
4. **Execute** → `$SQLCMD -Q "..."` or `$SQLCMD -i file.sql` for multi-statement.
5. **Verify** → Query affected table (`SELECT COUNT(*)`, `SELECT TOP 5`).
6. **Deploy (optional)** → Extract with `sqlpackage /Action:Extract` for .dacpac; set up source control.

## Gotchas, Rules, Troubleshooting

For full authoring gotchas: [SQLDB-AUTHORING-CORE.md](../../../common/SQLDB-AUTHORING-CORE.md) Authoring Gotchas and Troubleshooting.
For CLI-specific issues: [COMMON-CLI.md](../../../common/COMMON-CLI.md) Gotchas & Troubleshooting (CLI-Specific).

### MUST DO

- **Verify workspace has capacity before creating database** — call `GET /v1/workspaces/{id}` and check `capacityId`.
- **Always `-d <DatabaseName>`** — FQDN alone is insufficient.
- **Always `-G` or `--authentication-method`** — SQL auth not supported on Fabric.
- **Follow [COMMON-CLI.md](../../../common/COMMON-CLI.md) authentication guidance first** — `ActiveDirectoryDefault` depends on an authenticated CLI session.
- **Specify collation at creation** — cannot be changed after the database is created.
- **Use SqlPackage for repeatable deployments** — extract .dacpac → publish for incremental schema changes.
- **Use `-i file.sql`** for multi-statement batches (CREATE PROCEDURE, transactions with GO separators).
- **`SET NOCOUNT ON;`** in scripts — suppresses row-count messages that corrupt output.

### AVOID

- **ODBC sqlcmd** (`/opt/mssql-tools/bin/sqlcmd`) — use the Go version.
- **Omitting `-W`** in scripts — trailing spaces corrupt CSV.
- **Hardcoded FQDNs** — discover via REST API.
- **MARS** — not supported. Remove `MultipleActiveResultSets`.
- **`CREATE LOGIN` / SQL authentication** — Entra users only.
- **Modifying tables with CCI / `ALTER INDEX ALL` while mirroring is active** — stop mirroring or alter individual indexes.
- **`vector` / `json` columns on tables that must mirror** — cannot be mirrored to OneLake.
- **Special characters in DB / column names** — see [Limitations Reference](../../../common/SQLDB-AUTHORING-CORE.md#limitations-reference).
- **Modifying `.sqlproj` in source-controlled repo** — reset on next sync.
- **Unsupported features** (CDC, Always Encrypted, in-memory, ledger, full-text GA, partition SWITCH, `EXECUTE AS`, `hierarchyid`/`sql_variant`/`timestamp` PKs, CTAS, COPY INTO) — see [Limitations Reference](../../../common/SQLDB-AUTHORING-CORE.md#limitations-reference) for the full list.
- **Exceeding resource limits** (32 vCores, 4 TB, 1024 GB tempdb, 150 DBs/workspace).

### PREFER

- **`az rest`** for database creation over portal — scriptable and repeatable.
- **SqlPackage publish (.dacpac)** over manual DDL for schema evolution — tracks incremental changes.
- **Enforced constraints** (PK, FK, CHECK, DEFAULT) — SQL Database supports them fully, unlike DW.
- **Temporal tables** for audit trails and slowly-changing dimensions — full system-versioning available. Note: history table is excluded from mirroring.
- **Data virtualization** (external tables / OPENROWSET) to query OneLake without ETL. Note: external tables themselves are not mirrored.
- **`INSERT ... SELECT`** for bulk data movement within the database.
- **BCP** for high-performance bulk import/export.
- **Native AI functions / sp_invoke_external_rest_endpoint** for embedding generation in T-SQL.
- **`sqlcmd (Go) -G`** over curl+token for SQL queries.
- **`-Q`** (non-interactive exit) for agentic use.
- **`-i file.sql`** over `-Q "..."` for anything beyond simple one-liners.
- **`-F vertical`** for exploration of wide tables.
- **Env vars** (`FABRIC_SERVER`, `FABRIC_DB`) for script reuse.
- **Auto-tuning** — let the engine manage indexes; check `sys.dm_db_tuning_recommendations` periodically.
- **Optimized locking** — enabled by default; reduces lock memory and eliminates lock escalation.

### TROUBLESHOOTING

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| SqlPackage auth error | Use `Authentication=Active Directory Default` in connection string |
| `Login failed for user` | Verify `-d` matches database display name exactly (case-sensitive) |
| `Cannot open server` / `Login timeout expired` | Re-discover FQDN via REST API; check port 1433 / firewall |
| `ActiveDirectoryDefault` failure | `az login` session may be expired — refresh Azure CLI authentication per `common/COMMON-CLI.md` |
| Collation error after creation | Cannot change — must recreate database with desired collation |
| Foreign key violation on INSERT | Check referenced table has matching row; verify column types |
| Vector insert dimension mismatch | Ensure vector literal has exactly the declared dimensions |
| CCI creation fails on existing table | Stop mirroring, create index, restart mirroring. CCI created inline with CREATE TABLE also prevents mirroring of that table |
| Table not mirrored after DDL change | DDL changes trigger a full data reseed; table with unsupported PK type or >1000 tables are skipped |
| Vector/json column prevents mirroring | Tables with `vector` or `json` columns cannot be mirrored; use OLTP endpoint to query these |
| Computed columns missing from analytics endpoint | Computed columns are skipped during mirroring |
| LOB data truncated on analytics endpoint | LOB columns > 1 MB are truncated in OneLake |
| `ALTER INDEX ALL` fails | Not allowed while mirroring is active; alter individual indexes by name |
| Garbled CSV / `(N rows affected)` in file | Add `-W -s"," -w 4000`; prepend `SET NOCOUNT ON;` |
| `sp_invoke_external_rest_endpoint` 401 | Create/verify database-scoped credential for target URL |
| `sqlcmd` not found | Ensure `sqlcmd` is installed and on `PATH`; follow the shared CLI setup guidance in `common/COMMON-CLI.md` |
| Connection fails on redirect ports | Connection policy requires ports 11000–11999 open in addition to 1433 |
