# Supported item types for Fabric deployment pipelines

Reference list of the Fabric item types that deployment pipelines can copy from one
stage to another. **This list changes over time** as workloads onboard to CI/CD and
graduate items out of preview — treat it as a living document.

- **Canonical source (source of truth):** [Introduction to deployment pipelines § Supported items](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/cicd/deployment-pipelines/intro-to-deployment-pipelines#supported-items)
  on Microsoft Learn. Reconcile this table against that page.
- **How to keep this current:** re-fetch the docs page above and reconcile this table
  (add/remove rows, update the `Status` / preview flags). An item is **supported** when
  the docs list it under *Supported items*. Do not hand-edit from memory.
- **Status** below reflects the docs: **GA** for generally-available items; **preview**
  for items the docs mark as in preview.
- **Last reconciled:** 2026-07-20 (against the public docs page, `updated_at` 2026-07-17).

> **Retirement note:** Beginning **February 12, 2026**, deployment pipelines retire
> support for semantic models that have **not** been upgraded to Enhanced Metadata.
> See [Retirement of semantic model support](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/cicd/troubleshoot-cicd#retirement-of-semantic-model-support-for-deployment-pipelines).

## How to use this list

- Only items in this list are copied during a deploy; unsupported items in a source
  workspace are simply skipped (not an error).
- For a **selective** deploy, each entry in the deploy `items` array is
  `{ "sourceItemId", "itemType" }`. The `itemType` is the Fabric REST **item type name**
  (e.g. `SemanticModel`, `Report`, `Notebook`, `Lakehouse`, `SparkJobDefinition`,
  `DataPipeline`, `Eventhouse`, `KQLQueryset`, `Dataflow`). The display names below come
  from the docs and may differ from the REST enum value — **read the exact `itemType`
  back from `GET .../stages/{stageId}/items`** rather than guessing it.
- `preview` items may behave differently or require the item's own preview to be enabled.

[^kqldb]: **KQL databases** are deployed as part of their parent **Eventhouse** rather
    than as a standalone entry. In a selective deploy the KQL database still surfaces as
    its own `itemType` in the stage-items list; read the exact value back from
    `GET .../stages/{stageId}/items`.
